# Omni Analytics Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that helps analytics engineers and data teams work with [Omni Analytics](https://omni.co) programmatically through Omni's REST APIs.

## Installation

### From Marketplace (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add exploreomni/omni-claude-skills
/plugin install omni-analytics@omni-analytics
```

### From Git URL

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/exploreomni/omni-claude-skills.git
/plugin install omni-analytics@omni-analytics
```

## Setup

After installation, set these environment variables:

```bash
export OMNI_BASE_URL="https://yourorg.omniapp.co"
export OMNI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

API keys are created in **Settings > API Keys** (Organization Admin) or **User Profile > Manage Account > Generate Token** (Personal Access Token for Modeler/Connection Admin roles).

> **Token security**: These tokens appear in terminal scrollback when used in shell commands. For team deployments, consider loading tokens from a secrets manager or wrapping API calls in an MCP server. See `omni-admin` for details.

## Skills

This plugin includes 8 skills that Claude activates automatically based on your request:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **omni-model-explorer** | Discover and inspect models, topics, views, fields, and relationships. Includes field impact analysis. |
| **omni-model-builder** | Create and edit views, topics, dimensions, measures, and relationships in YAML |
| **omni-query** | Run queries against Omni's semantic layer and interpret results |
| **omni-content-explorer** | Find, browse, and organize dashboards, workbooks, and folders |
| **omni-content-builder** | Create, update, and manage documents and dashboards programmatically — lifecycle, tiles, filters, layouts |
| **omni-ai-optimizer** | Optimize your Omni model for Blobby (Omni's AI assistant) |
| **omni-admin** | Manage connections, users, groups, permissions, schedules, and token security |
| **omni-embed** | Embed dashboards in external applications — URL signing, custom themes, iframe events |

## Usage

Just ask Claude naturally — skills activate automatically:

```
"What topics are available in our Omni model?"          → omni-model-explorer
"Run a query showing revenue by month"                  → omni-query
"Add a new dimension for customer tier to the users view" → omni-model-builder
"Find the dashboard about sales performance"            → omni-content-explorer
"Build a dashboard showing revenue by month"             → omni-content-builder
"Improve the AI context on our orders topic"            → omni-ai-optimizer
"Give the marketing team access to the sales dashboard" → omni-admin
```

## Team Deployment

To make this plugin available to your entire team automatically, add it to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "omni-analytics": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "exploreomni/omni-claude-skills"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": ["omni-analytics@omni-analytics"]
}
```

When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code automatically installs the marketplace and plugin.
